# BarberProblem

Please save c++ file "main.cpp" to linux system, then compile it using the following commands on linux:

  g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -o main -pthread

Then run it by:

  ./main


Remarks:

I changed the generating rate of customers from every 3 seconds to every 2 seconds, for better observation of barber sleeeping, barber waking up and working, customer waiting in the waiting room, and customer leaving.
